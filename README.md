as you.

### What is this repository for?

* Quick summary
* [Issue Tracking](https://github.com/Elkyw/LANGLE/issues)

### why this ??

* For nothing!

### Run the program

* Run the program like you normally would with Python by typing ` python main.py `. If you're on Windows, you can run ` langle.exe.`
* On one computer, click on "Server," then hit "Connect" and choose any desired port.
* On the other computer, click on "Client," then hit "Connect." Type in the port number followed by the IP address of the computer that is acting as the server.
* Boom! You're all set to have a blast chatting!

###### And here are some extras:

* If you want to change your username, simply click on "File" and select "Change Username." You can also use commands like "/nick" (similar to Minecraft) to personalize your chat identity.
* Just so you know, we've thoroughly tested this tool on our school computers, and it runs as smoothly as butter. No kidding, it's super reliable.

### Note
- I have a theory which is like using this tool as a chatting system which we can access through web. 
may in upcomming feature i will try to create it .
